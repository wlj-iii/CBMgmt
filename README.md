## Project Overview

The previous method of chromebook management for hundreds of Laker Elementary, Middle,
& High School students & staff for previous years mainly consisted of manual data entry
and retrieval using multiple Google sheets and manual entry of data into Google Admin.

Although adequate for the seasons in which they were used, the manual
record-keeping ended up causing much confusion & headache due to: 
- too many sources of 'truth'.
- frequent data entry errors (i.e. - misspelled names, inconsistency with casing, etc.).
- duplicate entries.
- missing entries.
- overall lack of ease with usability. 

This new 'Database' was designed and built to be the next improved-upon iteration for
device management during the 2023-2024 school year. 

The Database aims to improve the following:
- data integrity (i.e. - zero duplicate entries, multiple copies of each entry in
  several Log points to make certain the correct accounts have the correct devices,
  balances, due dates, etc.).
- efficiency (i.e. - the ability to manage all aspects of our records and management
  from one operator-friendly and well-known UI: Google Workspace) 
- usability (i.e. - devices can be checked-in/out in less than 30 seconds while
  maintaining complete data and account integrity, as well as managed in an easy-
  to-understand Google Spreadsheet for any entry-level Tech Coordinators)
